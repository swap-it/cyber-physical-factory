Start the Cyber-Physical Factory Docker Application
***************************************************
Pre-build docker containers for all software components that are required to start the Application Scenario are available in the repository's container registry. With these containers, it is possible to start a docker-compose project to provide all ressources necessary to test the SWAP-IT architecture. To start this docker-compose environment, start docker on your local device. Clone the *swap-it-cyberphysicalfactory* repository and enter it from a terminal. Afterwards, the project can be started with the docker compose command:

.. code-block:: python

    git clone https://github.com/swap-it/cyber-physical-factory
    cd cyber-physical-factory

Writing PFDL files
******************
Throughout the tutorials section, the *Cyber-Physical Factory* PFDL is recreated. However, to get a deeper insight into the PFDL and its usage, please have a look at `Production Flow Description Language (PFDL) <https://github.com/iml130/pfdl>`_.
