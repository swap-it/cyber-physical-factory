As part of the `Fraunhofer lighthouse project SWAP-IT <https://www.fraunhofer.de/de/forschung/fraunhofer-initiativen/fraunhofer-leitprojekte/swap.html>`_, several Fraunhofer Institutes faced the challenge of providing a solution for manufacturing companies to deal with batch sizes ranging from number 1 to large series and to be prepared for delays and failures in the supply chains. This resulted in the development of the `SWAP-IT architecture <https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9926665>`_. The new technological concept comprehensively reflects the requirements of tomorrow's production. It enables a transformation from rigidly connected single-purpose production systems to flexible and dynamic networks of individual processing stations. The focus is on modular production systems that support both centrally and decentrally organized components. The modules can be adapted to the requirements of the production environment and can be further developed with little effort.

Within the *Large Scale Workpieces* use case the Fraunhofer IWU developed a solution for the production of large scale, metallic workpieces on small machine tools (`Fraunhofer lighthouse project SWAP-IT <https://www.iwu.fraunhofer.de/de/Ueber-uns/netzwerke/fraunhofer-netzwerke/fraunhofer-leitprojekt-swap.html>`_). The developed concept requires several machine control systems to be connected to a master control level and to distribute orders. A prototypical implementation was successfully implemented and demonstrated in `Large scale workpieces by segmentation <https://www.produktion.fraunhofer.de/de/forschung-im-verbund/formate/leitprojekte/swap/grossbauteilfertigung.html>`_. A second focus of the Fraunhofer IWU in this project was the connection of various machines and systems to the `SWAP-IT architecture <https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9926665>`_. This approach is based on the `Skill-based control framework <https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/robotics-and-ai/articles/10.3389/frobt.2022.1014476/full>`_, which enables the standardized provision of production technology services, even for different control system manufacturers. Specific challenges were identified and addressed during the development stage. The solution approach for overcoming these difficulties is demonstrated in the success story *Cyber-Physical Factory* illustrated by a complex hybrid component. The process is first implemented and tested with a simulation model and later transfered to the real production systems. During the first stage the `Skill-based control framework <https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/robotics-and-ai/articles/10.3389/frobt.2022.1014476/full>`_ is utilized to simulate the production assets. Subsequently the framework is used to call provided services of real assets.
